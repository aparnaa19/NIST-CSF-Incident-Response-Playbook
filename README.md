## Overview

A structured incident response playbook for three common security incidents, mapped to the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. This project demonstrates understanding of the incident response lifecycle, security operations workflow, and industry-standard frameworks used in real SOC environments.

> Phishing scenarios validated through hands-on analysis on TryHackMe (Phishing Analysis Fundamentals).

## Incidents Covered

| Playbook | Severity Range | NIST Functions Covered |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|

## NIST CSF Framework — Quick Reference

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Identify** | Understand the scope and assets involved |
| **Protect** | Implement safeguards to limit impact |
| **Detect** | Identify occurrence of a security event |
| **Respond** | Take action on a detected incident |
| **Recover** | Restore capabilities after an incident |

## Severity Classification

| Level | SLA | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| S4 — Low | 72 hrs | Minimal impact, likely false positive |
| S3 — Medium | 24 hrs | Isolated to one user/system, unconfirmed breach |
| S2 — High | 4 hrs | Active confirmed threat, multiple systems affected |
| S1 — Critical | 1 hr | Business disruption, data exfiltration likely |
